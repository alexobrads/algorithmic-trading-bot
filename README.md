# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is in the early development stage. The aim is to explore and test various machine learning models for predicting stock prices. At this stage, the focus is primarily on evaluating different types of ML algorithms to identify which ones offer the most promise.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9.19
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:alexobrads/algorithmic-trading-bot.git
    cd algorithmic-trading-bot

    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Tested Models

We have explored and tested various machine learning models to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting stock prices, including:

1. **Gaussian Processes**: 
   - A non-parametric approach widely used for regression tasks.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
   - A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) highly effective for time-series forecasting.
3. **Neural Networks**:
   - Various architectures of neural networks, including both shallow and deep networks, for regression and forecasting tasks.


## Usage

### Running Experiments

Use the Jupyter notebooks available in the `notebooks` directory to run different experiments. You can open the notebooks using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
